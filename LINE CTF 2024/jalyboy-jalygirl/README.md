The exception handling was the same as in the previous challenge, so I decided to utilize tools provided by a Burp extension.

Fortunately, I obtained the flag without prior knowledge of **`CVE-2022-21449`**.

This vulnerability is well-known, hence the Burp extension includes a tool specifically for testing it.
